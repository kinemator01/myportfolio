# 👨🏽‍💻 Banele Phali – Personal Portfolio  

This repo holds the code for my **personal portfolio website**.  
Right now it’s pretty simple — just an intro, an about section, and navigation. I’m leaving it as a work-in-progress until I’ve built more projects worth showcasing.  

---

## 🖼️ Current Features  

- **Intro Section**: Quick intro (name, what I do, and where I’m from).  
- **About Section**: A short bio about my studies, interests, and goals.  
- **Navigation**: Basic nav bar for Home, About, Projects, and Contact.  
- **Particles.js Background**: Animated background effect.  
- **Responsive Design**: Works across desktop and mobile.  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  

- **HTML5** – structure  
- **CSS3** – styling (`styles.css`)  
- **JavaScript** – small interactions (`script.js`)  
- **Particles.js** – animated background

## ⚡ What’s Next  

This is just the **skeleton** of my portfolio.  
I plan to add:  
- **Projects section** – once I’ve built and polished more apps/sites.  
- **Contact form** – so people can reach me directly.  
- **Animations & polish** – make the site look cleaner + more professional.
